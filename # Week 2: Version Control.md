# Week 2: Version Control

## Topic: Version Control
Version control is a system that records changes to files over time so you can track history, revert to previous versions, and collaborate with others effectively.

## Key Concepts:
- **Repository (Repo):** Project folder tracked by Git.
- **Remote:** A repository stored online (e.g., GitHub).
- **Local:** Your copy on your computer.
- **Commit:** A snapshot of changes.
- **Branch:** Separate line of development.
