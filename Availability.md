# Week 2: Summary of group activities 

## Topic: Group Activities Summary 
- Did IRAT in groups on Git questions that were based on pre-readings 

## Git Basics
### Common Git Commands:
- `git init` – Initialize a new repository
- `git clone <url>` – Copy an existing repository
- `git add <file>` – Stage changes for commit
- `git commit -m "message"` – Save changes with a message
- `git status` – Show changes and staging status
- `git log` – Show commit history
- `git push` – Upload local commits to remote repository
- `git pull` – Fetch and merge changes from remote repository

### Talked about Staging vs Committing:
- **Staging:** Prepares changes to be saved (via `git add`)
- **Committing:** Saves staged changes with a description (via `git commit`)

## Talked about Branching:
- `git branch` – List or create branches
- `git checkout <branch>` – Switch to a branch
- `git merge <branch>` – Merge a branch into the current one

## Key Concepts:
- **Repository (Repo):** Project folder tracked by Git.
- **Remote:** A repository stored online (e.g., GitHub).
- **Local:** Your copy on your computer.
- **Commit:** A snapshot of changes.
- **Branch:** Separate line of development.
